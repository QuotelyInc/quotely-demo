# GitHub Actions Vercel Deployment Fix

## Current Issue
The Vercel CLI is detecting the VERCEL_ORG_ID and VERCEL_PROJECT_ID environment variables and attempting to link to an existing project, but failing because there's no valid .vercel/project.json file.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Use Vercel's Official GitHub Action (Recommended)
Replace the deployment steps with Vercel's official action:

```yaml
- name: Deploy to Vercel
  uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v25
  with:
    vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
    vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
    vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
    vercel-args: '--prod'
    working-directory: ./
```

### Option 2: Manual Vercel Setup

1. **Remove GitHub Secrets temporarily**
   - Go to: https://github.com/QuotelyInc/quotely-platform/settings/secrets/actions
   - Delete VERCEL_ORG_ID and VERCEL_PROJECT_ID (keep VERCEL_TOKEN)

2. **Let Vercel create a new project**
   Update the workflow to:
   ```yaml
   - name: Deploy to Vercel (Production)
     run: vercel --prod --yes --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }} --name=quotely-platform
   ```

3. **After first successful deployment**
   - Check the GitHub Actions logs for the new project ID
   - Re-add the secrets with the new IDs

### Option 3: Direct Local Deployment (Immediate Solution)

From your local machine, you can deploy right now:

```bash
cd quotely-platform
rm -rf .vercel
vercel --prod
```

This will:
1. Prompt you to log in (already done)
2. Create/link the project
3. Deploy to production

## Current Deployment Status

The latest code changes are all committed to GitHub:
- ✅ Mobile responsiveness
- ✅ Accurate pricing ($999/month)
- ✅ Company description (Q4 2025 launch)
- ✅ Verified partners section
- ✅ Accurate features with AI cost comparison
- ✅ Removed all false statistics

## Next Steps

1. **For immediate deployment**: Use Option 3 (local deployment)
2. **For CI/CD fix**: Implement Option 1 (Vercel's official action)
3. **Alternative**: Temporarily remove the ORG_ID and PROJECT_ID secrets

## Manual Deployment Command

If you want to deploy immediately from your local machine:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\dusti\quotely-platform
Remove-Item .vercel -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
vercel --prod
```

This will deploy the latest code to production immediately.
