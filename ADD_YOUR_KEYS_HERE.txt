HOW TO ADD YOUR API KEYS SAFELY:

1. Open .env.local in a text editor (NOT in this chat)
   - Use Notepad, VS Code, or any text editor
   - DO NOT share the contents in chat

2. Find this line:
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_chatgpt_pro_key_here

3. Replace it with:
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY_HERE

4. Save the file

5. Test with: npm run env:check

REMEMBER:
- NEVER share API keys in chat, email, or commits
- Each key should only be in your local .env.local file
- If a key is exposed, revoke it immediately

After revoking the exposed key and getting a new one, add it to .env.local directly.
